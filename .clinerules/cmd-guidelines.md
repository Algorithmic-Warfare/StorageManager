# Commandline Rules

!!! Keep this in mind everytime you are about to send commands to the shell via MCP tools. !!!

- The default location of a new terminal is the root folder `~/git/Algorithmic Warfare/Tribe-MUD-DApp-Scaffold`
- Always make sure you `cd` into the right directory before running any command.
- Thie workspace is composed of two packages, `./packages/contracts` and `./packages/client`.
- To test health of the `./packages/client`
```sh
pnpm build
```
