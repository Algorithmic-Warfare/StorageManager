# **HOW TO MARKDOWN.md**

## **Guide to Markdown for Documentation and Issue Reporting**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text. It's widely used for documentation, README files, and issue descriptions because it's easy to read and write. This guide covers the essential Markdown syntax you'll need for drafting clear and structured issues and other project documentation.

### **1\. Headings**

Headings help organize your content into logical sections. Use hash symbols (\#) at the beginning of a line.

\# Heading 1  
\#\# Heading 2  
\#\#\# Heading 3  
\#\#\#\# Heading 4  
\#\#\#\#\# Heading 5  
\#\#\#\#\#\# Heading 6

### **2\. Paragraphs and Line Breaks**

* **Paragraphs:** Markdown treats consecutive lines of text as a single paragraph. To create a new paragraph, leave a blank line between blocks of text.  
* **Line Breaks:** To force a line break within a paragraph, add two spaces at the end of the line, then press Enter.

This is the first line of a paragraph.  
This is still part of the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.  
This line is followed by two spaces at the end.    
This forces a line break.

### **3\. Emphasis (Bold and Italics)**

* Italics: Use a single asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_) around the text.  
  \*italic text\* or \_italic text\_  
* Bold: Use double asterisks (\*\*) or underscores (\_\_) around the text.  
  \*\*bold text\*\* or \_\_bold text\_\_  
* Bold and Italics: Combine them.  
  \*\*\*bold and italic text\*\*\* or \_\_\_bold and italic text\_\_\_

### **4\. Lists**

#### **Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)**

Use asterisks (\*), hyphens (-), or plus signs (+) followed by a space.

\* Item 1  
\* Item 2  
  \* Nested Item A  
  \* Nested Item B  
\- Another Item  
\+ Yet Another Item

#### **Ordered Lists (Numbered)**

Use numbers followed by a period and a space. Markdown will automatically increment the numbers.

1\. First item  
2\. Second item  
   1\. Nested ordered item  
   2\. Another nested item  
3\. Third item

### **5\. Code Blocks and Inline Code**

#### **Inline Code**

Use backticks (\`) around short snippets of code within a sentence.

This is some inline code within a paragraph.

#### **Code Blocks**

For larger blocks of code, use three backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code. You can specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., javascript, python, markdown).

\`\`\`javascript  
function greet(name) {  
  console.log(\`Hello, ${name}\!\`);  
}  
greet("World");  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python  
def factorial(n):  
    if n \== 0:  
        return 1  
    else:  
        return n \* factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  
\`\`\`

### **6\. Links**

Create clickable links using square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL.

\[Link Text\](https://www.example.com)

Visit \[Google\](https://www.google.com) for searches.

### **7\. Blockquotes**

Use the greater-than sign (\>) at the beginning of a line to indicate a blockquote.

\> This is a blockquote.  
\> It can span multiple lines.  
\>\> Nested blockquote.

### **8\. Horizontal Rules**

Create a horizontal line to separate content using three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (\*\*\*), or underscores (\_\_\_) on a line by themselves.

\---

\*\*\*

\_\_\_

### **9\. Images (Less Common in Issue Reports, More in Docs)**

Use an exclamation mark (\!), followed by alt text in square brackets, and the image URL in parentheses.

\!\[Alt text for the image\](https://placehold.co/150x75/000000/FFFFFF?text=Image)

### **10\. Tables (For Structured Data)**

Use hyphens (-) for the header separator and pipes (|) to separate columns.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |  
| \-------- | \-------- | \-------- |  
| Row 1 Col 1 | Row 1 Col 2 | Row 1 Col 3 |  
| Row 2 Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 | Row 2 Col 3 |

### **Tips for Drafting Issues and Docs:**

* **Readability First:** While Markdown adds formatting, the primary goal is clear, concise, and easy-to-read content.  
* **Consistency:** Try to be consistent in your use of Markdown elements across your documentation.  
* **Preview:** Many platforms (like GitHub, GitLab, and our internal tools) offer a preview function. Use it to ensure your Markdown renders as intended before submitting.

Mastering these basic Markdown elements will significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of your issue reports and all other documentation\!
