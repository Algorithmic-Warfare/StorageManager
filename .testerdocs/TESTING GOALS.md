# TESTING GOALS

## **Builder Tester Call: Testing Goals**

This document outlines the key objectives and focus areas for the upcoming Builder Tester Call. Your mission is to rigorously evaluate the builder scaffold and provide comprehensive feedback that helps us refine it into a robust and reliable foundation for our collective.

### **Primary Objectives:**

1. **Review the Scaffold:**  
   * Familiarize yourselves with the overall structure, included components, and documentation (if any).  
   * Understand the intended architecture and design principles.  
2. **Use the Scaffold (Build with it):**  
   * Actively attempt to build small applications, components, or modules using the scaffold.  
   * Follow the provided setup instructions and workflows.  
   * Test its usability from the perspective of a new builder.  
3. **Break the Scaffold:**  
   * Intentionally push the scaffold to its limits.  
   * Try edge cases, unconventional inputs, and unexpected configurations.  
   * Identify potential failure points, vulnerabilities, or areas of instability.  
4. **Identify What's Missing:**  
   * Determine any crucial features, tools, libraries, or configurations that are absent but would significantly enhance the scaffold's utility or completeness for standard development practices.  
   * Consider common patterns in Frontend, MUD Dev, and CI/CD that are not yet supported.  
5. **Report Issues (Bugs, Gaps, Improvements):**  
   * Document all bugs, errors, crashes, and unexpected behaviors.  
   * Clearly articulate missing features or functionalities.  
   * Suggest improvements to existing features, performance, developer experience, or documentation.  
   * **Refer to HOW\_TO\_ISSUE.md for detailed reporting guidelines.**  
6. **Provide Detailed Relevant Feedback:**  
   * Beyond just reporting issues, offer insights into *why* certain aspects are good or bad.  
   * Share your overall impressions of the developer experience.  
   * Suggest potential solutions or alternative approaches where appropriate.

### **Specific Focus Areas:**

Based on the announcement, we are particularly interested in insights related to:

* **Frontend Development:** Ease of integrating UI frameworks, component creation, styling, and general web development patterns.  
* **MUD Development:** Specific functionalities or integrations relevant to Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) development, if applicable.  
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** The scaffold's support for automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines.  
* **Onboarding Experience:** How intuitive and easy it is for a developer with "no prior experience but with great interest in frontier building" to get started and use the scaffold effectively.

Your rigorous testing and thoughtful feedback will directly contribute to establishing robust standards and a common starting point for all our builders. Thank you for being core contributors\!
