# RULES OF CONDUCT

## **Builder Tester Call: Rules of Conduct**

Welcome, Builders and Testers\! This document outlines the expected conduct and collaboration guidelines for our upcoming Builder Tester Call. Adhering to these rules will ensure a productive and positive environment for everyone involved.

### **1\. Respect and Professionalism**

* **Be Respectful:** Treat all participants (fellow testers, builders, and organizers) with respect. Disagreements should be handled professionally and constructively.  
* **Constructive Criticism:** All feedback, positive or negative, should be constructive and focused on the scaffold itself, not on individuals. Explain *why* something is an issue or a good idea.  
* **Inclusivity:** Foster an inclusive environment. We value diverse perspectives and experiences.

### **2\. Collaboration and Communication**

* **Active Participation:** Engage actively in the testing process and the special group chat. Your insights are invaluable.  
* **Clear Communication:** When reporting issues or providing feedback, be as clear, concise, and detailed as possible. Refer to the [HOW TO ISSUE](./HOW%20TO%20ISSUE.md) guide for best practices.  
* **Listen and Learn:** Be open to understanding different viewpoints and learning from others' experiences.

### **3\. Focus and Purpose**

* **Stay On-Topic:** Discussions in the group chat should primarily revolve around the scaffold, testing, issues, and feedback.  
* **Goal-Oriented:** Remember the primary goals of this call: to review, use, break, identify missing elements, report issues, and provide relevant feedback on the builder scaffold.

### **4\. Confidentiality (Implicit)**

* **Internal Discussion:** Information shared, issues discovered, and discussions held during this testing phase are for internal use within the Builder Tester Call group. While not explicitly stated in the announcement, it is generally good practice to treat prototype information with discretion.

### **5\. Timeliness and Commitment**

* **Timely Feedback:** Strive to provide your feedback and reports within the designated testing week.  
* **Commitment:** By volunteering, you commit to actively participating and providing valuable input.

By participating in the Builder Tester Call, you agree to uphold these rules of conduct. We are excited to collaborate with you to improve our collective building standards\!
